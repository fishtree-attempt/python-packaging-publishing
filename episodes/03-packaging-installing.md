## Recall: Functions

When we develop research code we organize it into functions and classes.

These might be in notebooks or you might have put them in a `.py` file. If you've never put them in another file.


<!-- Step zero from notebook to .py; then up to pip as an intermediate step to stage up -->


FIXME: Example on writing functions to motivate packaging

What is my modular resuable code vs what is my analysis
Keep motivation as easing in  and gradually scaling up to stay inclusive


## Pip

Pip stands for FIXME is used to install packages from [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/). PyPI is a repository for python package that are developed by Python Community. Pip works by fetching package from this repository and installing it locally.

We use pip at the command line. We'll start by exploring it's help manual.

## Python Packages

A module is a piece of code that serves a specific purpose. In python, a module is written in a **.py** file and the name of the file is name of the module. A module can contain classes, functions, or a combination of both. Modules can also define variables for use, for example, `numpy` defines the value of pi (`numpy.Pi`).

Packages are namespaces or containers (e.g. a directory) which can contain multiple packages and modules.

Making python code a package (packaging it) requires no extra tools. We need to:

- Create a directory and give it package's name.
- Put modules in it.
- Create a __init__.py file in the directory
- Create a setup.py file at the top leel

The __init__.py file tells python that the directory is supposed to be read as a package.

e.g.

Let us create a package called **Vehicles** with two modules **Land** and **Water**.

### Step 1: Creating a directory
Create a directory called **Vehicles**

~~~
mkdir packagename
~~~
{: .language-bash}

### Step 2: Adding Modules

~~~
class Land:
    def __init__(self):
        ''' Constructor for this class. '''
        # Create some vehicles
        self.members = ['Cars', 'Trucks']

    def printMembers(self):
        print('Printing members of the Land  class')
        for member in self.members:
            print('\t%s ' % member)
~~~
{: .language-python}

The class has a property named members â€“ which is a list of some vehicles we might be interested in. It also has a method named printMembers which simply prints the list of vehicles of this class.Note: all classes defined must be capable of being imported, and won't be executed directly. this will be saved in a file called **Land.py**

Next we create another module named **Water**. Create a file named **Water.py** inside the **Vehicles** directory and add the code below:

~~~
def isWater(v):
    waterv =['ship', 'boat']
    for obj in v:
        if obj in waterv:
            print("It is a water vehicle")
        else:
            print("It is not a water vehicle")
~~~
{: .language-python}

Note the code here is a function that checks which items in a list are water vehicles.

### Step 3 Adding the init file

Finally, we create a file named __init__.py inside the **Vehicles** directory and add the following code:
~~~
from Land import Land
from Water import isWater
~~~
{: .language-python}

Now we can import the package **Vehicles**

e.g

~~~
from Vehicles import Land, Water

v1 =Land()
v1.printMembers()

v2= ["boat", "car"]
isWater(v2)
~~~
{: .language-python}

> ## Exercise
> Add a module for air vehicles with a function that checks if an air vehicle is also a water vehicles (e.g. hovercraft)
>

## SetupTools

FIXME: how to setup the setup.py file

~~~
mport setuptools

with open("README.md", "r") as fh:
    long_description = fh.read()

setuptools.setup(
    name="example-pkg-your-username",
    version="0.0.1",
    author="Example Author",
    author_email="author@example.com",
    description="A small example package",
    long_description=long_description,
    long_description_content_type="text/markdown",
    url="https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject",
    packages=setuptools.find_packages(),
    classifiers=[
        "Programming Language :: Python :: 3",
        "License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License",
        "Operating System :: OS Independent",
    ],
)
~~~
{: .language-python}

## Installing locally

Now that our code is organized into a package, how can we use it? If we try importing it now, what happens?

We need to install it first.  There are many ways that `pip` can install code.  We saw before that it can install from PiPy, but it can also install from a local diretory.

~~~
cd
pip install .
~~~
{; .language-pythons}


Now we can try importing and using our package.

## Getting a Package from A Colleague

Many projects are distributed via GitHub as open source projects, we can use pip to install those as well.

Using git clone

Download and unzip their folder

Direct download?


~~~
cd project_dir
pip install .
~~~
{: language-bash}


## PiPy Submission

To make `pip install packagename` work you have to submit your package to the repository.  We won't do that today, but an important thing to think about if you might want to go this direction, is that the name must be unique.  This mens that i's helpful to check pipy before creating your package so that you chooses a name that is availalbe.

To do this, you also need to package it up somewhat more. There are two types of archives that it looks for, as 'compiled' versions of your code. One is a source archive (`tar.gz`) and the other is a built distribution (`.whl`).  The built version will be used most often, but the source archive is a backup and makes your package more broadly compatible.

The next step is to generate distribution packages for the package. These are archives that are uploaded to the Package Index and can be installed by pip.

Make sure you have the latest versions of setuptools and wheel installed:

~~~
python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade setuptools wheel
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
~~~
{: language-bash}
This command should output a lot of text and once completed should generate two files in the dist directory:

~~~
dist/
  example_pkg_your_username-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl
  example_pkg_your_username-0.0.1.tar.gz
~~~
{: language-bash}

Finally, itâ€™s time to upload your package to the Python Package Index!

First, we'll register for accounts on Test PyPI, intended for testing and experimentation. This way, we can practice all of the steps, without publishing our dummy code that we've been working with.

Go to [test.pypi.org/account/register/](https://test.pypi.org/account/register/) and complete the steps on that page, then verify your account.

Now that you are registered, you can use twine to upload the distribution packages. Youâ€™ll need to install Twine:

~~~
python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade twine
~~~
{: .language-bash}
Once installed, run Twine to upload all of the archives under dist:

~~~
python3 -m twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*
~~~
{: .language-bash}

You will be prompted for the username and password you registered with Test PyPI. After the command completes, you should see output similar to this:

~~~
Uploading distributions to https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
Enter your username: [your username]
Enter your password:
Uploading example_pkg_your_username-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl

~~~
{: .language-bash}
Once uploaded your package should be viewable on TestPyPI, for example, https://test.pypi.org/project/example-pkg-your-username

test by having your neighbor install your package.

Since they're nonsene, we should uninstall once we're done with `pip uninstall`
