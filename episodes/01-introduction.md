## A Data Analysis Project

In small groups, let's describe all of the steps we might go through and the things we want our project to do.  Then we'll discuss some of the components.  

## Data and Code

 - Different back up needs, differnt space requirements
 - Different sharing needs
 - Shared server examples

## Types of Code

 - scripts, numerical experiments, plotting(that get narrative)
 - things that are project specific
 - things that are method-related might be reused
    - these can be grouped as a package for install and then imported
    -

## Environments

 - the set of requirements and dependencies
 - what version of differt  sotware and pacakges
 - don't need to track it ourselves, the environment is like a wrapper
 - many different managers; one is conda

## Documentation

 - demonstrate and publicize what you did (beyond an academic paper)
 - help your team use your code
 - clarify your thinking to do it in real time
 - multiscale: overview, details,
 - need to write the parts in natural language; but don't need to work on the infrastrcutre, tools can do that for you


## Project Organization

Now that we've brainstormed the parts of a project and talked a little bit about what each of them consists of.  How should we organize the code?

There isn't a specific answer, but some guiding principles.

Let's look around on github for some examples and compare and contrast them.
