teaching: 0
exercises: 0
questions:
- "What are common features of a project?"
- "What do I need to do to get my project shared?"
- "What will this lesson cover"
objectives:
- "Categorize pieces of code and organize them for efficient future use"
- "Identify components of a complete project"
keypoints:
- Projects have common structures
- "Packaging enables a project to be installed"
- "An environment allows different people to all have the same versions and run software more reliably"
- "Documentation is an essential component of nay complete project and should exist with the code"

This episode will introduce the various tools that will be taught throughout the lesson and how the components relate to one another.  This will set the foundation and motivation for the lesson.

## A Data Analysis Project

> ## Exercise
> In small groups, describe all of the steps you might go through in developing a project, how it could work, and the things you want your project to do.
> Then discuss problems you anticipate or have had.
>
> > ## Solution
> > The rest of the episode adds them
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge} 

## Data and Code

 - Different back up needs, different space requirements
 - Different sharing needs
 - Shared server examples

## Types of Code

 - scripts, numerical experiments, plotting(that get narrative)
 - things that are project specific
 - things that are method-related might be reused
    - these can be grouped as a package for install and then imported
    -

## Environments

 - the set of requirements and dependencies
 - what version of differt  sotware and pacakges
 - don't need to track it ourselves, the environment is like a wrapper
 - many different managers; one is conda

## Documentation

 - demonstrate and publicize what you did (beyond an academic paper)
 - help your team use your code
 - clarify your thinking to do it in real time
 - multiscale: overview, details,
 - need to write the parts in natural language; but don't need to work on the infrastrcutre, tools can do that for you


## Project Organization

Now that we've brainstormed the parts of a project and talked a little bit about what each of them consists of.  How should we organize the code?

There isn't a specific answer, but some guiding principles.

Let's look around on github for some examples and compare and contrast them.
