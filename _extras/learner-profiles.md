## Tyrone Tensor
Tyrone is a PhD student in machine learning. He develops novel methods to analyze healthcare data and wants his collaborators to be able to use his packages.  He is a Carpentries instructor and will teach a workshop to the researchers at the hospital research lab. He would like to add a module after to teach them to use the techniques he developed in his most recent study.

This lesson will teach him to prepare and package his work so that his clinical collaborators can use his techniques.

## Marzyeh Microglia

Marzyeh is a lab manager of a neuroscience lab. With many of the PhD students in the lab, she recently completed a software carpentry workshop together. The lab has converted the analysis pipeliens into a number of specialized functions.  They have also developed a number of custom visualizations that all members of the lab are supposed to use.  Currently, the students all commit the plotting functions to a common repository for storage and then copy and paste them into their individual projects. They frequently have errors and conflicts with different versions packages between students who have older installs and new installs of python.

This lesson will teach Marzyeh to package the research code for the students so that they can share efficiently. It will also teach her best practices for creating environments to resolve the version conflicts.


## Cristina Calibration

Cristina is a post doc in machine learning and has a paper that she recently published and released the code for. Her paper was selected, for an oral presentation at a top conference and is now generating a high rate of inquiries. Her e-mail inbox is full of redundant inquires about how to use the project and helping users install the right version of requirements. She has drafted default replies that she sends to each person.   

This lesson will help Maria learn to improve the online documentation for her paper and add environment information so that users can use her technique faster and with fewer e-mails.
