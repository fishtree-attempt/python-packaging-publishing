This project is a part of the Mozilla Open leaders Program as, "Good Enough Open Source Practices for Python Data Analysis Projects." Through this project sprint, the goal is to gather the necessary information, complete an outline and gather preliminary materials to facilitate an initial pilot run of the workshop.

There will be a pilot run of the workshop in February 2019 at Brown University, Providence, RI USA.  If you are interested in hosting a pilot (including self study) comment on [this issue](https://github.com/brownsarahm/python-data-project/issues/43).  


# Getting Started: Python Data Project

This is to be a collaboration among scientific computing researchers and educators to develop accessible tutorial materials and minimal templates that empower researchers developing new analysis techniques to release them in formats that encourage community adoption. We're working open to model the practices that the lesson teaches. By working open, we hope to increase the impact of the templates and tutorials by encouraging learners to contribute back.


This tutorial will cover some next steps for getting your python-based data analysis project organized and ready to share.  See the [learner profiles](https://brownsarahm.github.io/python-data-project/learner-profiles/index.html) with collaborators or in general. What differentiates this project from others is that it aims to specifically target minimal effort, maximal benefit open source practices to help researchers who want to share their work with minimal overhead.  

## Contributing

This lesson is in early development as a part of the Mozilla Open Leaders Cohort 6 and participating in Hacktoberfest.  For Hacktoberfest, please check [the Hacktoberfest label on issues](https://github.com/brownsarahm/python-data-project/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AHacktoberfest) and the [roadmap](https://github.com/brownsarahm/python-data-project/projects/2)
Maintainers will do their best to help you if you have any
questions, concerns, or experience any difficulties along the way.


This project is not an official project of the Carpentries, but it is inspired by the Carpentries. We adopt the Carpentries Code of Conduct, but reporting should be to the maintainers of this project.  The style guide of the Carpentries below also applies to this project.  

We'd like to ask you to familiarize yourself
with our [Contribution Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md)
and have a look at the [more detailed Carpentries guidelines][lesson-example] on proper formatting,
 ways to render the lesson locally, and even how to write new episodes.
