# Workshops

If you are interested in hosting a pilot (including self study) comment on [this issue](https://github.com/brownsarahm/python-data-project/issues/43) to get support and help incorporate your feedback better.




# Mozilla Open Leaders

This project was a part of the Mozilla Open leaders Cohort 6 as, "Good Enough Open Source Practices for Python Data Analysis Projects." Through that project sprint, the goal was to gather the necessary information, complete an outline and gather preliminary materials to facilitate an initial pilot run of the workshop.


# Getting Started

This is to be a collaboration among scientific computing researchers and educators to develop accessible tutorial materials and minimal templates that empower researchers developing new analysis techniques to release them in formats that encourage community adoption. We're working open to model the practices that the lesson teaches. By working open, we hope to increase the impact of the templates and tutorials by encouraging learners to contribute back.


This tutorial will cover some next steps for getting your python-based data analysis project organized and ready to share.  See the [learner profiles](https://brownsarahm.github.io/python-data-project/learner-profiles/index.html) with collaborators or in general. What differentiates this project from others is that it aims to specifically target minimal effort, maximal benefit open source practices to help researchers who want to share their work with minimal overhead.
