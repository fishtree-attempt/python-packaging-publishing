Data Carpentry workshops provide the fundamentals to learning to use scientific computing to facilitate research. In this lesson, we look at some next steps and examples of best practices for organizing a project. We will integrate the data organization ideas from the Spreadsheets lesson with coding in Python and explore how to share code within a lab and as published material.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  prereq

## Prerequisites

Data Carpentry Spreadsheets Lesson and a Software or Data Carpentry Python
are the minimum requirements.  This material will be easier to follow some
time after the workshop and you've spent some time incorporating those
practices into your own work.

This lesson also assumes comfort with the unix command line, but the command
line operations could be done through a GUI instead and plain language
explanations that accompany command line sections may be enough for a user
comfortable creating files and folders and moving them around to do so without
use of the command line.
