# Next Steps for a Data Analysis in Python Projects


> ## Prerequisites
>
> Data Carpentry Spreadsheets Lesson and a Software or Data Carpentry Python
> are the minimum requirements.  This material will be easier to follow some
> time after the workshop and you've spent some time incorporating those
> practices into your own work.
>
> This lesson also assumes comfort with the unix command line, but the command
> line operations could be done through a GUI instead and plain language
> explanations that accompany command line sections may be enough for a user
> comfortable creating files and folders and moving them around to do so without
>  use of the command line.
